# Professional PDF Report Suggestions

This document outlines recommendations for improving the generated project and meeting reports.

## Cover Page
- Include company logo, project title, client name, engineer name and creation date.
- Provide report type (daily report, phase completion, meeting log, etc.).

## Table of Contents
- For multi‑page reports, generate a table listing section titles with page numbers.
- Use `pdf` package widgets to compute page indices after document generation if needed.

## Standard Sections
- **Executive Summary** – short overview of progress or meeting outcomes.
- **Updates/Notes** – chronological list of entries with timestamps and responsible engineers.
- **Tests/Inspections** – summary table of performed tests with status and results.
- **Requests/Materials** – table showing requested items, quantities and statuses.

## Data Visualisation
- Use charts (e.g. bar charts or progress indicators) for phase completion percentage and resource usage. Generate charts using `fl_chart` in Flutter and convert them to images for embedding in the PDF.

## Additional Data Points
- Pull timestamps for each update from Firestore and display them beside notes.
- Show engineer responsible for each task or phase.
- For admins, include material quantity comparisons and basic budget information if available.

## Visual Style
- Apply consistent fonts and colours from `AppConstants`.
- Keep margins generous and use whitespace for clarity.
- Add page footer with company contact details and disclaimers (see `PdfStyles.buildFooter`).

## Signatures and Approval
- Include captured digital signatures using the `signature` package.
- Present an approval stamp or image after finalised reports.

## QR Codes
- Continue using QR codes linking to the online version of the report via `buildReportDownloadUrl`.
